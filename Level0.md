 --> LEVEL 0
 
**SSH Connection:** 
After entering your SSH username and password, you should access your personal directory, typically represented by "~."

**Initial Exploration:** 
Use the `ls` command to examine the files and directories present in your personal directory. This command will give you an overview of the elements around you.

**Navigation to the "level" folder:** 
Since the Warchall teams indicate that the solutions are located in the "/home/level" folder, use the `cd /home/level` command to move to this specific directory.

**Opening the "00_welcome" folder:** 
In the "level" directory, open the "00_welcome" folder using the command `cd 00_welcome`. This is necessary because we are currently at level 0, and solutions may be organized into specific folders.

**Opening the README.md file:** 
Identify the README.md file using the `ls` command. Then, to read its content, type `cat README.md`.

**Analyzing the README.md file:** 
Read the content carefully to find clues or instructions. The solution to level 0 is mentioned in the last sentence of the file.
