 ## Level 0

 

 - After entering your SSH username and password, access your personal directory using `cd ~` and use `ls` to overview the files.
 
-  Use `cd /home/level` to move to the "/home/level" directory.

 -  In the "level" directory, open "00_welcome" with `cd 00_welcome`.
 
 -   Use `cat README.md` to read the contents; carefully examine for clues, and the level 0 solution in the last sentence.
