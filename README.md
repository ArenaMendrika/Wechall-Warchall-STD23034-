Examen individuel SYS1


First time on WeChall?

    Begin your journey on WeChall (https://www.wechall.net/) by clicking on the registration button located at the top right of the page.
    After completing this initial step, proceed with the login as a user, similar to the approach on platforms like Facebook. Our ongoing challenge is named Warchall.
    To tackle this challenge, it is imperative to create an SSH account. Consider this step as establishing a private pathway on the Internet. You will be prompted to set and confirm a secure password using the "(RE)SET your SSH account" option. This is where things get serious.
    Complete the preparation by opening a terminal. I personally used PuTTY, but you can also choose other SSH clients that support remote connection to a server, such as Termius, OpenSSH, or others of your choice. Ensure that you configure the SSH client correctly to successfully start the challenge.
