 
## Level 12 (Py - Tong)

 - In this level, the goal is to execute the "pytong" program. 
 - To achieve this, we will provide it with a text using the 'echo' command. 
 - In my case, I will simply call it 'text'.
 -  Therefore, the command to accomplish this is :
 

    `./pytong <(echo text)`

     and by doing so, we can get the solution.
