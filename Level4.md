 ## Level 4
 - Enter the 04_kwisatz folder with `cd /home/level/04_kwisatz`, and check for files using `ls` where you should find a file named README.nfo.
 
 - Follow the README.nfo to your personal directory, use `cd ~`  and then `cd /level/04_kwisatz`, inside you should see a file "README.txt".
 
 - README.txt advises navigating to README2.md, currently inaccessible. Check permissions on README2.md using `ls -al`, add read permission with `chmod +r README2.md` 
 -  Open README2.md with `cat README2.md` to access the solution
