## Level 10 (Choose your path)

 - In this level, we will execute the program "charp" located in the directory "/home/level/10_your_path". Make sure to navigate to this directory first. 
 

   `cd /home/level/10_choose_your_path`


 - After that, we will redirect the output of the command to another file, which will be created in our home directory. In my case, I will name it "ten.txt". All of these actions can be accomplished in a single command:
 

   ` ./charp "so & cat solution.txt > ~/ten.txt"`

 - Finally , go to your home directory and open the content of the "ten.txt" file using: `cat ten.txt` to get the solution
