## Level 1

 - Use `cd /home/level/01_choice_tree` to access the level1 folder, then explore its contents with `ls`.
 
  - Since the solution wasn't in README.md, Use `cd blue/hats/grey` to move through the folders, starting from "blue" and going into "hats" and then "grey."

- Use `cd solution/` , then  `cd patience/` .
 
 - Use `cat SOLUTION.txt` to display its contents and retrieve the solution for level1.
